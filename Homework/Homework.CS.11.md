1. How do you define a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments?
  - By using the params keyword as the parameter modifier
2. How do you call a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments?
  - By calling the method name and passing your arguments as parameters.
3. Why canâ€™t you use an array to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a method?
  - You can use an array but you would have to write out each array separately  
4. How many parameters can a method have?
  - As many as you want
5. Do parameter arguments have to have the same type?
  - No, they will be put in an object array
6. What is the difference between a method that takes a parameter argument and one that takes optional
arguments?
  - One that takes optional arguments has a fixed parameter list
  - One that takes a parameter arguments can have an arbitrary list of parameters and none of them have a default value.
7. How do you define a method that takes different (and arbitrary) types of arguments
  - By using an object array (params object [] paramList)
