1. **What is a local variable?**
is a type of variable declared by local variable declaration at the beginning
of a block the variable is intended to be local to.

2. **What is a statement?**
is a command that performs an action such as calculating a value and storing the result
or displaying a message to a user.

3. **What is an identifier?**
the names that you use to identify the elements in a program
It's a name. identifier consists of alphabetical character's digits or _ (cannot begin with a digit)

4. **What is a variable?**
..*A name location in memory that holds a value.

5. **What is a method?**
block of code that specifies behavior

6. **Are primitive types and value types the same thing? (not in book)**
yes. Primitive types are most common value types i.e.: string, int, bool

7. **How are arithmetic operators and variable types related?**
Certain operators can only be used with certain variable types.
EX: char, and int can use + - \ * while string can only use + and bool cannot use any

8. **How do you turn an integer into a string?**
   .toString

9. **How do you turn a string into an integer?**
   Int32.Parse

10. **What is the difference between precedence and associativity?**
 Give an example where this makes a difference.
Precedence determine the order in which you evaluate operators and associativity
is the direction in which way you go in order to perform the operation.
2+3*4

11. **What is the definite assignment rule?**
Means you have to assign a value to a variable. otherwise your program will not run.

12. **How are the prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators evaluated differently?**
prefix the operator comes first is evaluated before the before the increment
postfix the operator come after the fact and the operator is evaluated after.

13. **What is string interpolation?**
It replaces the "+" with a "$" at the start of the string
it replaces the name with the data.

14. **What does the var keyword do?**
causes the compiler to deduce the type of the variables from the types of the expressions
used to initialize them.
instructs the computer to guess what type of variable it is
